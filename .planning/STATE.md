# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-02)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Extract xml_parser.py BEFORE deleting any code from ingest_stenografici.py (Pitfall 5)
- Phase 1: Embedding cache key must not change — model name string "text-embedding-3-small" is frozen
- Phase 1+2: Phase 1 schema rebuild and Phase 2 Cypher updates MUST deploy as a unit
- Phase 4: NER model version compatibility must be validated during planning (it_nerIta_trf requires spaCy 3.2.x — may need it_core_news_lg instead)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1] Embedding model name discrepancy: PROJECT.md says text-embedding-ada-002 but code uses text-embedding-3-small. Fix the doc during Phase 1 — do not change code.
- [Pre-Phase 2] SSE event contract (18 yield sites in query.py) must be documented before any router refactoring. Payload field names are a frozen contract.
- [Pre-Phase 4] NER version compatibility: bullmount/it_nerIta_trf requires spaCy >=3.2.1,<3.3.0. Validate against current stack before scheduling NER work.
